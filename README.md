# Dynamic_Economic_Modeling
This repo contains all the material used to develop macro's assignment.

Files containing solutions are:
- "Answers.pdf" for the questions about the two tables.

- "Exercise_2.ipynb" is the python notebook in which the tables were re-created. It also contains comments on how I proceeded.

- "Assignment Exercise 1" for exercise 1.

The file "rates.xls" and "CPI.xls" are series I used into the python notebook and in it I explained how they've been used.

The file "sources" contains all the sources used, as a summary.

The file problem set 1 is there just to remember the questions of the assignment.
